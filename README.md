## For the moment this is just a POC.

It does work to a point. It will display any plugins that have updates available based on the date to installed them.

It will not automatically install them, instead giving you the link to download them yourself.

Plugin developers just need to make sure their plugin is on the https://plugins.scpslgame.com/ site, preferably if their author name is the same as their Github name, but is not nessecary.
